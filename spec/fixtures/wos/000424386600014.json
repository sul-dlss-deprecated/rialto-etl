Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Many studies use GEO data to shape hypotheses and improve statistical power. Within GEO, the Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 are the two most commonly used microarray platforms for human samples; the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform contains 54 220 probes and the HG-U133A array contains a proper subset (21 722 probes). When different platforms are involved, the subset of common genes is most easily compared. This approach results in the exclusion of substantial measured data and can limit downstream analysis. To predict the expression values for the genes unique to the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform, we constructed a series of gene expression inference models based on genes common to both platforms. Our model predicts gene expression values that are within the variability observed in controlled replicate studies and are highly correlated with measured data. Using six previously published studies, we also demonstrate the improved performance of the enlarged feature space generated by our model in downstream analysis.","count":1}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":3,"grant":[{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":["GM102365","LM05652","GM61374"],"count":3},"grant_agency":"National Institutes of Health"},{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":"IC2014-1387","count":1},"grant_agency":"Pfizer"},{"grant_agency":"National Science Scholarship from A*STAR, Singapore"}]},"fund_text":{"p":"This work supported by the National Institutes of Health [GM102365, LM05652, GM61374]; and Pfizer [IC2014-1387].

Dissecting the specific combination of factors that bind each target is a significant challenge. Here, we describe in detail the Allele Binding Cooperativity test, which uses variation in transcription factor binding among individuals to discover combinations of factors and their targets. We developed the ALPHABIT (a large-scale process to hunt for allele binding interacting transcription factors) pipeline, which includes statistical analysis of binding sites followed by experimental validation, and demonstrate that this method predicts transcription factors that associate with NF kappa B. Our method successfully identifies factors that have been known to work with NF kappa B (E2A, STAT1, IRF2), but whose global coassociation and sites of cooperative action were not known. In addition, we identify a unique coassociation (EBF1) that had not been reported previously. We present a general approach for discovering combinatorial models of regulation and advance our understanding of the genetic basis of variation in transcription factor binding.","count":1}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":2,"grant":[{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":["LM007033","LM05652","GM61374"],"count":3},"grant_agency":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},{"grant_agency":"Department of Energy"}]},"fund_text":{"p":"The authors would like to acknowledge Maya Kasowski, Fabian Grubert, and Jan Korbel for their helpful discussions.

Support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks are currently among the most popular and accurate QSAR methods because they learn new representations of the data that greatly improve modelability. In this work, we use shallow representation learning to improve the accuracy of L1 regularized logistic regression (LASSO) and meet the performance of Tanimoto SVM. We embedded chemical fingerprints in Euclidean space using Tanimoto (a.k.a. Jaccard) similarity kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and compared the effects on LASSO and SVM model performance for predicting the binding activities of chemical compounds against 102 virtual screening targets. We observed similar performance and patterns of improvement for. LASSO and SVM. We also empirically measured model training and cross-validation times to show that KPCA used in concert with LASSO classification is significantly faster than linear SVM over a wide range of training set sizes. Our work shows that powerful linear QSAR methods can match nonlinear methods and demonstrates a modular approach to nonlinear classification that greatly enhances QSAR model prototyping facility, flexibility, and transferability.","count":1}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":2,"grant":[{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":["GM102365","GM61374"],"count":2},"grant_agency":"NIH"},{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":"EB020405","count":1},"grant_agency":""}]},"fund_text":{"p":"S.E.R. and R.B.A. were supported by NIH Grants GM102365 and GM61374.

Unfortunately, the noise level and experimental variability of microarrays can be limiting. While a number of existing methods partially overcome these limitations by incorporating biological knowledge in the form of gene groups, these methods sacrifice gene-level resolution. This loss of precision can be inappropriate, especially if the desired output is a ranked list of individual genes. To address this shortcoming, we developed M-BISON (Microarray-Based Integration of data SOurces using Networks), a formal probabilistic model that integrates background biological knowledge with microarray data to predict individual DE genes.","Results: M-BISON improves signal detection on a range of simulated data, particularly when using very noisy microarray data. We also applied the method to the task of predicting heat shock-related differentially expressed genes in S. cerevisiae, using an hsf1 mutant microarray dataset and conserved yeast DNA sequence motifs. Our results demonstrate that M-BISON improves the analysis quality and makes predictions that are easy to interpret in concert with incorporated knowledge. Specifically, M-BISON increases the AUC of DE gene prediction from .541 to .623 when compared to a method using only microarray data, and M-BISON outperforms a related method, GeneRank. Furthermore, by analyzing M-BISON predictions in the context of the background knowledge, we identified YHR124W as a potentially novel player in the yeast heat shock response.","Conclusion: This work provides a solid foundation for the principled integration of imperfect biological knowledge with gene expression data and other high-throughput data sources."],"count":3}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":1,"grant":{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":["U01 GM061374","5U01GM061374-08"],"count":2},"grant_source":"Medline","grant_agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS"}}},"normalized_doctypes":{"doctype":"Article","count":1}}},"r_id_disclaimer":"ResearcherID data provided by Clarivate Analytics","dynamic_data":{"citation_related":{"tc_list":{"silo_tc":{"coll_id":"WOS","local_count":5}}},"cluster_related":{"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"type":"issn","value":"1471-2105"},{"type":"art_no","value":"ARTN 214"},{"type":"doi","value":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-214"},{"type":"xref_doi","value":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-214"},{"type":"pmid","value":"MEDLINE:18439292"}]}}}}

The surfeit of protein structural data enables development of computational methods to systematically derive rules governing structural-functional relationships. However, performance of these methods depends critically on the choice of protein structural representation. Most current methods rely on features that are manually selected based on knowledge about protein structures. These are often general-purpose but not optimized for the specific application of interest.","In this paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) technology to structure-based protein analysis. The framework automatically extracts task-specific features from the raw atom distribution, driven by supervised labels. As a pilot study, we use our network to analyze local protein microenvironments surrounding the 20 amino acids, and predict the amino acids most compatible with environments within a protein structure. To further validate the power of our method, we construct two amino acid substitution matrices from the prediction statistics and use them to predict effects of mutations in T4 lysozyme structures.","Results: Our deep 3DCNN achieves a two-fold increase in prediction accuracy compared to models that employ conventional hand-engineered features and successfully recapitulates known information about similar and different microenvironments. Models built from our predictions and substitution matrices achieve an 85% accuracy predicting outcomes of the T4 lysozyme mutation variants. Our substitution matrices contain rich information relevant to mutation analysis compared to well-established substitution matrices. Finally, we present a visualization method to inspect the individual contributions of each atom to the classification decisions.","Conclusions: End-to-end trained deep learning networks consistently outperform methods using hand-engineered features, suggesting that the 3DCNN framework is well suited for analysis of protein microenvironments and may be useful for other protein structural analyses."],"count":4}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":1,"grant":{"grant_ids":{"grant_id":["GM102365","LM05652","HL117798"],"count":3},"grant_agency":"NIH"}},"fund_text":{"p":"This work is supported in part by NIH GM102365, LM05652 and HL117798."}},"normalized_doctypes":{"doctype":"Article","count":1}},"contributors":{"contributor":{"name":{"seq_no":1,"orcid_id":"0000-0003-3859-2905","role":"researcher_id","full_name":"Altman, Russ","last_name":"Altman","display_name":"Altman, Russ","first_name":"Russ"}},"count":1}},"r_id_disclaimer":"ResearcherID data provided by Clarivate Analytics","dynamic_data":{"citation_related":{"tc_list":{"silo_tc":{"coll_id":"WOS","local_count":1}}},"cluster_related":{"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"type":"issn","value":"1471-2105"},{"type":"art_no","value":"ARTN 302"},{"type":"doi","value":"10.1186/s12859-017-1702-0"},{"type":"pmid","value":"MEDLINE:28615003"}]}}}}
